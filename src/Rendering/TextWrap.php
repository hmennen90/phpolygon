/**
 * Greedy line breaking, shared by every renderer that wraps text.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Wrapping used to be `explode(' ', $paragraph)` — repeated in three places,
 * and wrong for every script that does not separate words with spaces.
 * Japanese and Chinese write a whole sentence as one uninterrupted run of
 * characters: to a space-splitter it is a single "word", so a line longer than
 * the column has no break opportunity at all and simply overflows. The text
 * does not clip, it runs off the panel.
 *
 * HOW A BREAK OPPORTUNITY IS FOUND
 * --------------------------------
 * Two kinds of opportunity, following the spirit of UAX #14 without shipping
 * its full table:
 *
 *   1. Between space-separated words, as before.
 *   2. Between adjacent CJK characters (Han, Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul and
 *      the full-width forms), because each one is a legitimate line start.
 *
 * Two exceptions keep punctuation where a reader expects it:
 *
 *   - A line never STARTS with closing punctuation — the small kana, the
 *     sound mark, the full stop, the closing bracket. Those glue to the
 *     character in front of them.
 *   - A line never ENDS with opening punctuation — an opening bracket glues
 *     to the character behind it.
 *
 * Latin words are never split mid-word: a single word wider than the column
 * keeps its own line and overflows, which is the conventional (and least
 * surprising) behaviour.
 *
 * The measuring callback is supplied by the caller, so wrapping always agrees
 * with what that particular renderer will actually draw — including its font
 * fallback chain.
